Credit Score Range	Rating	Effect on Loans
300 - 399	Bad	Not eligible for loans 🚫
400 - 599	Poor	Eligible for small loans (up to $500) 💵
600 - 749	Good	Eligible for higher loans (up to $5,000) 🚀
750 - 850	Excellent	Lowest interest rates & highest loan amounts 🏆



4️⃣ What is totalPayable?
totalPayable = Loan Amount + Interest

Example	Loan Amount	Interest Rate	Total Payable
User A (400 credit score)	$500	15% (high risk)	$575
User B (750 credit score)	$2,000	8% (low risk)	$2,160
User C (850 credit score)	$5,000	5% (best rate)	$5,250
Formula:
ts
Copy
Edit
totalPayable = approvedAmount + (approvedAmount * interestRate);
So, higher credit scores = lower total payable because the interest is lower.
